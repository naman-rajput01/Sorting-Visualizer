Heap sort
Features:

Colored representation of step being executed: 
1.1) Black:default 
1.2) Yellow: Being compared 
1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 
1.4) Green: On correct position


3 Controls for visualizations:
2.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels) 
2.2) Data size (20-150) 
2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new array).


Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
